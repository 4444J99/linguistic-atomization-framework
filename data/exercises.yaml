  # Ethos - Establishing Credibility
  - id: ethos-authority-beginner
    name: "Establishing Authority"
    category: ethos
    difficulty: beginner
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) that establishes your expertise
      on a topic of your choice. Imagine you're writing the opening of
      a persuasive essay and need readers to trust your perspective.
    tips:
      - Reference relevant credentials, experience, or research
      - Cite authoritative sources or statistics
      - Use confident but measured language
      - Avoid overstatement or absolute claims
    example: |
      As a marine biologist with fifteen years of field research experience,
      I have witnessed the alarming decline in coral reef ecosystems firsthand.
      According to NOAA, we have lost approximately 50% of the world's coral
      reefs since 1950. My research team's findings confirm that rising ocean
      temperatures are the primary driver of this devastation.

  - id: ethos-acknowledgment-intermediate
    name: "Acknowledging Limitations"
    category: ethos
    difficulty: intermediate
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) where you acknowledge the limitations
      or weaknesses in your own argument, while still maintaining your overall
      position. This demonstrates intellectual honesty and builds trust.
    tips:
      - Identify a genuine weakness or counterargument
      - Address it directly without dismissing it
      - Explain why your position holds despite this limitation
      - Use hedging language appropriately
    example: |
      While my proposal for universal basic income shows promise, I acknowledge
      that funding such a program presents significant challenges. Critics
      rightly point out that the estimated $3 trillion annual cost would require
      substantial tax increases. However, this concern overlooks the potential
      savings from reduced administrative costs of existing welfare programs.

  # Pathos - Emotional Appeal
  - id: pathos-narrative-beginner
    name: "Personal Story"
    category: pathos
    difficulty: beginner
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) that uses a personal story or vivid
      example to create an emotional connection with readers. The story should
      support a larger point you want to make.
    tips:
      - Use specific, concrete details
      - Appeal to universal emotions (hope, fear, compassion)
      - Show, don't just tell
      - Connect the story to your broader argument
    example: |
      I still remember the day my grandmother showed me her hands-weathered and
      scarred from decades of factory work. "These hands," she said, "built the
      life you have now." She worked twelve-hour shifts for thirty years, never
      missing a day, all so her children could go to college.

  - id: pathos-urgency-intermediate
    name: "Creating Urgency"
    category: pathos
    difficulty: intermediate
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) that creates a sense of urgency about
      an issue. Make readers feel that action is needed now, not later.
      Avoid being alarmist while still conveying importance.
    tips:
      - Use time-related language ("now," "before it's too late")
      - Present consequences of inaction
      - Include specific, credible stakes
      - Balance urgency with credibility
    example: |
      Every day we delay action on cybersecurity, we leave our critical
      infrastructure vulnerable to attacks that could shut down hospitals,
      disable power grids, and compromise financial systems. Last month alone,
      ransomware attacks cost American businesses over $20 billion.

  # Logos - Logical Appeal
  - id: logos-evidence-beginner
    name: "Supporting with Evidence"
    category: logos
    difficulty: beginner
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) that makes a claim and supports it
      with concrete evidence. Use statistics, research findings, or specific
      examples to build a logical argument.
    tips:
      - State your claim clearly upfront
      - Provide specific, credible evidence
      - Explain how the evidence supports your claim
      - Use transition words to show logical connections
    example: |
      Investing in early childhood education yields significant long-term
      economic benefits. The Perry Preschool Study found that every dollar
      invested in quality preschool programs returned $7 to $12 to society
      through reduced crime, lower welfare costs, and higher tax revenues.

  - id: logos-counterargument-intermediate
    name: "Addressing Counterarguments"
    category: logos
    difficulty: intermediate
    prompt: |
      Write a paragraph (100-150 words) that presents a counterargument to
      your position and then refutes it with logical reasoning. This shows
      you've considered multiple perspectives.
    tips:
      - Present the counterargument fairly (don't strawman)
      - Acknowledge any valid points it makes
      - Provide specific reasons why it falls short
      - Use logical connectors (however, nevertheless, despite this)
    example: |
      Critics of remote work argue that it reduces collaboration and harms
      company culture. This concern has merit-spontaneous hallway conversations
      do foster certain types of innovation. However, research from Stanford
      shows that remote workers are 13% more productive than their office
      counterparts, and companies report no significant decrease in output.
