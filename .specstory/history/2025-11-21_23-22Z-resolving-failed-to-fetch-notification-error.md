notification error: Failed to fetch

I'll help you investigate this "Failed to fetch" notification error. Let me first check what processes might be running and look at any recent terminal activity or code that could be making fetch requests. I found the issue! Your HTML visualization files are trying to fetch data files using relative paths, but they're likely being opened directly in a browser without a local web server. When you open HTML files with `` protocol, JavaScript fetch requests fail due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

Let me check if there's a simple server running and provide you with a solution: The error occurs because your HTML files need to be served through a web server to load JSON data. Let me start a simple HTTP server for you: Perfect! I've started a local HTTP server. Now you can access your visualizations at:

**Main visualizations:**
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/index.html (main index)
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/atomized_viewer.html
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/semantic_network.html
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/entity_browser.html
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/temporal_flow.html
- http://localhost:8000/visualizations/sentiment_map.html

The "Failed to fetch" error was happening because the HTML files were trying to load JSON data files, which browsers block when opening files directly (`` protocol). Now that the server is running, the fetch requests will work properly.

The server will keep running in the background. To stop it later, you can press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or close the terminal.
