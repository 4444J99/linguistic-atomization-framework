I can see you're getting a message about Node.js and npm. This is likely a VS Code notification related to certain extensions or features that require Node.js to be installed.

Let me check if Node.js is installed on your system: Node.js is installed, but npm might not be in your PATH. Let me verify: Both Node.js (v25.2.1) and npm (11.6.2) are already installed and working correctly on your system. 

The message you're seeing is likely a VS Code notification that appears when certain language extensions or linters want to use Node.js-based tools. Since Node and npm are installed, you can:

1. **Reload VS Code** - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` and run "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Dismiss the notification** - If it keeps appearing, it may be a bug with a specific extension

If the issue persists after reloading, it might be that VS Code isn't detecting Node.js properly. You can verify VS Code can see Node by checking its integrated terminal environment, which should already work based on the commands we just ran.
