On the day you arrive the place seems at once timeless and\ntemporary and all too familiar.\nA decade after your enlistment you will find yourself back in military town observing\nanew, passing through on your way from someplace you'd rather have stayed, on your way to\nsomeplace you'd rather already be. Fertile grounds. Nostalgia blooms. You\u2019ll find your favorite\nbarber, there\u2014or was it across the street?\u2014where you paid for the same haircut every Sunday\nand grew to crave that skin-tight fade the way a summer sheep longs to be shorn. The soft\nscream of a landing jet. A traffic star at the five-way intersection. Those two guards at the front\ngate who stare while you turn your truck away from base, watching you, following close the way\nthey never would have when you wore their same hairstyle.\nIn Jacksonville, North Carolina, which some ironically call Actionville, you could have\nyour hair cut by a new barber every week for a year, though with employee turnover in military\ntown, you learn, this experiment could last indefinitely.

Brilliant tagline, for\nsure, like, sign me up to swing a broad sword and release the dragon. The commercial kill. Show\nme a one shot Marine when real rounds come back in bursts. Fantasy fire. Take time for one shot\nand be the one killed. Hey, accuracy by volume\u2014machine gunner modus operandi. Is that really\nwhat they say? Or, if you mount the M240, you get both\u2014accuracy and volume. Big guns and\nbig dreams with big talk of manning crew-served weapons alone. Yikes. Keep those extra barrels\nand belts, headspace and timing. No calibration needed. Nothing too big to carry, right, like a\nnine on the thigh, in and out of the truck, sprint and roll, handheld, hey, no problem. No range,\neither. So, keep it on the go. Point blank. Concealed, see, up the sleeve if need be. First do no\nharm. Now isn\u2019t that sweet. Give me back my Mk 19. Show off. Why not? Let the belt hang,\nmount up and drop rounds downrange\u2014you want accuracy by volume?\u2014grenades in full-auto\nmeans accuracy by magic, poof, and you\u2019ve got purple fog from a crowd. Yikes on yikes. Might\nas well call in artillery. Where\u2019s the heart in a call? Oh, for a heart kill, well, nothing beats a\nfixed bayonet. Face to face. Maybe a buttstock to the chest. Blade in hand. Shit, hand to hand. A\nswift kick and a hammer fist. A war cry and a running start. A photo of Staff Sergeant\u2019s face mid\nwar cry. Blown up to the size of a road sign. Lashed to the grill of our lead truck like a warning.\nWhy warn them? Try Staff Sergeant\u2019s face just before orgasm. All the yikes. Cruel and unusual.\nA weapon of mass destruction? Best defense\u2014blindness. Imagine the collaterals. Staff Sergeant",

My rifle swings in one hand where it hangs from its sling and bounces\nwith each step. Laptop lights from a few of the windows. Steam pillows through a trailer door\u2014\nlook at that\u2014nearly midnight and the showers are still hot. I hide my nose in my neckline for a\ndeep breath\u2014do I smell already?

Jambo, the guards reply with smiles which never fail to echo.\nI\u2019m still smiling at the entrance to the recreation center, and I remind myself to drop it.\nBass pulses through the wall. I didn\u2019t realize there would be music\u2014lovely\u2014but there are no\nconvoys scheduled for the first of the year, as it happens, and I guess that\u2019s reason enough to\ndance. Late night on Al Asad, there really is nowhere else to go. The gym, perhaps. The picnic\ntables near the snack trailers\u2014fast food pizza and burgers which have oddly similar tastes. The\nold theater where arriving troops are briefed and departing troops debriefed and in which, it is\nrumored, officers commingle for drinks after dark. The motor pool, quiet and dim. The stadium",

She invited you to meet, to dance, to walk with her, so\u2014I know,\nI know I should go back, and I do. My knock is quick and loud.\nShe opens her door. Hello again. She\u2019s let her hair down already and I can hardly\nremember the importance of words.

Yeah, she tells me, I know a new year\u2019s kiss, and\nshe leans through her doorway, but this doesn\u2019t really count, and she touches my neck, so long\nafter the countdown, and she lets her breath fall over me, not quite the same, and she closes her\neyes, is it?

You haven\u2019t mentioned its name this whole time. I have not. But you will call the\ndog\u2019s name, for instance, when you are together, when you want it to listen. That\u2019s right.

The names we give to dogs. Why don\u2019t\nyou tell me this dog\u2019s silly name? There is only one dog in this story. I see. You see and you feel\nwithout need for silly names. Tell me a little more about it, then, what it looks like, let\u2019s start\nthere. Didn\u2019t you see it just then, see its weight across my shoulders, paws in my hands? I saw a\ndog, yes.

You haven\u2019t mentioned its name this whole time. I have not. But you will call the\ndog\u2019s name, for instance, when you are together, when you want it to listen. That\u2019s right. And yet\nyou don\u2019t use its name when you tell of it proudly in story. Is that suddenly a problem? What is\nthe name of your roommate\u2019s dog? Silly. What\u2019s silly? The names we give to dogs. Why don\u2019t\nyou tell me this dog\u2019s silly name? There is only one dog in this story. I see. You see and you feel\nwithout need for silly names. Tell me a little more about it, then, what it looks like, let\u2019s start\nthere. Didn\u2019t you see it just then, see its weight across my shoulders, paws in my hands? I saw a\ndog, yes. Let\u2019s keep it that way. What way is that? You seeing your dog on my shoulders and me\nimagining the dog I carried home.",
