# Modern Texts

Reserved for 20th–21st century texts.

## Status

This directory is currently empty. Modern texts require careful attention to copyright status before inclusion.

## Copyright Considerations

Works published after 1928 may still be under copyright in the United States. Before adding texts:

1. **Verify public domain status** - Check copyright expiration
2. **Consider Creative Commons** - Some modern works use permissive licenses
3. **Document the license** - Include clear attribution and terms

## Potential Additions

Public domain 20th century works that could be added:

- Works published before 1929 (US public domain)
- Works by authors who died before 1955 (some jurisdictions)
- Government documents (often public domain)
- Works explicitly released to public domain

## Adding Your Own Texts

You can add your own writing or appropriately licensed texts here for analysis. Create a subdirectory with:

```
modern/
└── your-text/
    ├── text.txt      # The text file
    └── README.md     # Source and license info
```
