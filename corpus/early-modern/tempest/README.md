## Notes

The Tempest is often considered Shakespeare's final solo-authored play. It's the shortest of his plays and one of only two (with The Comedy of Errors) that observe the classical unities of time, place, and action.

Key features for rhetorical analysis:
- **Dramatic structure**: Five acts, primarily dialogue
- **Mixed verse and prose**: Social register indicated by form
- **Meta-theatrical elements**: Prospero as playwright figure
- **Colonial themes**: Much modern scholarship focuses on Caliban

Unlike epic poetry, drama presents rhetoric through character speech rather than narrative, making it useful for studying dialogic and argumentative patterns distinct from the classical epics in this corpus.

The text follows the First Folio (1623), the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays published after his death.
