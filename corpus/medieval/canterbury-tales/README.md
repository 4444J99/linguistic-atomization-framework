## Notes

This is the **original Middle English text**, not a modern translation. Middle English is readable with practice but differs significantly from Modern English in spelling, vocabulary, and grammar.

Example opening:
> "Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote / The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote..."

The Canterbury Tales is notable for:
- Frame narrative structure (stories within a story)
- Range of genres (romance, fabliau, sermon, beast fable)
- Social commentary across medieval English society
- Mix of verse forms (heroic couplets, rhyme royal, prose)

This text is useful for studying how LingFrame handles historical English and for comparing medieval rhetorical conventions with classical and modern examples.
